# What are essential topics a trained RSE should know about?
- Moderator: [name=Philipp Thiele]


- How to talk about software (requirements etc.) especially when beeing the "early adoptor" in your field or an RSE helping with a project.
- To talk to management to introduce them to the benefit of software engineering.


## Software discovery and citability
- How to find software that maybe already does what I need or could be modified/expanded to do what I need for my research proposal etc. (Software discovery)
- Software evaluation after discovery. Does what I found actually suit my needs. Software evaluation.
- How to make your software discoverable. 
- How to cite software you find an use.
- What makes research software different from other software?


## Software requirement lists
- versioning (esp. semantic versioning, tags etc.)
- testing (What tests are there?) 
- release management 
- documentation
- portability/packaging 

## various
- Different tiers: actual hand on skills;  awareness of topics (legal, ethic, accessibility )
- Software/Project management
- Software ethics (possibilities for misuses) 
- Simple data analysis
- how to cope with legacy software? 

- (meta-topic on this theme) - I strongly believe RSEs should develop a [_Mastery Rubric_](https://masteryrubric.org/) for Research Software Engineering. A MR describes the different categories of skills/expertise in which people need to develop to achieve mastery in their discipline. It can help with curriculum design, professional development, legitimising a profession/career path, organising conference schedules, etc. If you are interested in helping make one of these exist for RSEng, please get in touch tobyhodges@carpentries.org

- Accessibilty for disabled users. Web content accessibility guidelines (Eli Chadwick elichadwick@carpentries.org)
