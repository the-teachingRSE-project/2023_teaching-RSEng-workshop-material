# Material archive for the deRSE23 workshop “Teaching and Learning Research Software Engineering”

The material was copied to git mainly from the then-used HedgeDoc pads for ease of access.
When you use this material, please note the [CC-BY license](LICENSE), but also note that this material includes presentations that may have to be cited separately.
Note: please do not use the git repository for citations.
Instead, use the version publised on Zenodo.

In addition, these data were refined, corrected, and generally improved to produce the publication „[Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer](https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1429/v1)”.
You may want to consider [citing](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.157778.1) it instead.

The git repository is not meant to provide a space to work on the material.
The material is provided in the state used at the workshop and should be considered “raw material”: not complete and not always correct.
No effort will be made to improve these data in any way: they are intended to be a snapshot of the information available at the event.

The best entrypoint is [deRSE23-session-pads-teaching-rseng.md](deRSE23-session-pads-teaching-rseng.md).
