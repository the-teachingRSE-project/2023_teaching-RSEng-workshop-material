- more money to SE taks
- devops
- testing (better), properly test !
- how to make a refined prodcut

## How do you learn best?

- copy and paste :D
- workshops (lecture coupled with practical plus support)
- pair programming (one computer, one keyboard)
- code review
- looking at other peoples code
- online: needs interaction, hands-on
- RSE is a handwerk, not just a process
- online missed socializing, thinking together works better
