# Reaching RSEe

:::danger

These notes still need some organization, to be done after workshop

:::

Seminar series to introduce RSE related topics
(ask departments to send at least one person to the event and share the news)
-> small commitment to get started 

During PhD onboarding, make them aware that there is RSE related courses

Mailing list of clusters to advertise courses 

Success stories are helpful to bring in 

Ask for sharing issues, to make people feel not alone

Make poeple aware that there is RSE, also as differnt career path -> catchy invitation

onboarding, but make it a bit later, as onboarding phase is already packed, we can wait a little

Doctoral/Graduate schools could offer a course

onboarding is great to reach , maybe a checklist, what you need to have done to reach the phd, maybe they even get credits

onboarding in different organizations is done differently. Differnt ways of reaching the right people, find weird way that works for them

no structure in onboarding, a banner in github or somewhere might work

-> better targeted than emails to everyone, depending on what course you want to advertise github may or may not be good

advertising git course on github might still work, 

mandatory course, visit to library was mandatory, appreciation/chore views, helped 

internet pass required to login to internet was needed to use dormitory internet


helpdesk reAach out -> people may contact helpdesk with all things related programming, technical people should know


how to spread the word, rather at uni and centers than complete institute, does not matter where the course happens

naming of courses is important " how I improve my research code" + subtitle ; "how to publish my software" / use success stories
