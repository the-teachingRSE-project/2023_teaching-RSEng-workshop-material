## RSE training/learning ressource collection

:raised_hands: Please add good resources to this [pad](https://pad.gwdg.de/teaching-RSE-resource-pad#) - if possible including some additional notes/info.

#### General

* Consider to publish your materials on [OERSI](https://oersi.org) as well or look it up for materials that you could use
* Reading recommendation: [How to engineer kindness](https://kind.engineering/)

#### HIFIS-related
* Here are the results of our [HIFIS 2020/21 RSE suvey](https://www.hifis.net/services/overall/survey)
* Feel free to use, remix, review, contribute to the [HIFIS teaching material](https://www.hifis.net/services/overall/learning-materials)


### Anything else? 
You're currently working on something in this space or are planning something?

Leave a note here and let's stay in touch.

> Teaching how to solve a problem vs doing it for them.
> One example of a fresh and active RSE group from Aalto University in Finland: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/ and their thoughts on becoming an RSE: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/

#### Hugo Gruson, (Email scrubbed for data protection)

Is this just a training issue? Or is there also an issue to retain RSEs within the research context, and not let them go to industry?
Unlike researchers, RSEs can perform their job in the private sector, and the conditions offered by research institutions are not good enough.

There was a workshop on "how to establish RSE-departements". They will write a white paper on this and are asking for issues on Github to that paper (once it is drafted). See https://pad.gwdg.de/deRSE23-session-pads-establishing-rses

#### Renato Alves, (Email scrubbed for data protection)

When defining what an RSE is, we often think a Researcher (`R`) that acquires software engineering (`SE`) skills. The reverse rarely happens.
Is the problem attractiveness? does it boil down to better pay/work-life-balance/... in industry? Something else?


#### Fredo Erxleben, (Email scrubbed for data protection)

How about we - as a community - write a short RSE primer to guide those new to the field, give recommendations on what to learn, where to look for ressources, and som general best practises.
As a community we can also get a nice variety of topics in there that we would otherwise maybe miss.

##### Insights from the HPC community

There are coordinated efforts in the High Performance Computing community to improve the skills and competences of research software engineers at a European level.

###### Teaching

The [PRACE](https://prace-ri.eu) initiative helps coordinate teaching of programming languages for modern hardware. While these courses sound tailored for HPC developers, many developers outside the HPC community can benefit from them too. As a concrete example, [here](https://www.hlrs.de/training/2023/cpp2) is an advanced C++ course that says in its introduction: "The course will not address special areas and applications of C++, such as for instance Template Meta Programming (TMP), or the quirks and curiosities of the C++ language. It rather teaches guidelines to develop mature, robust, maintainable, and efficient C++ code." (having attended it, I can confirm it has a strong emphasis on good coding practices). PRACE courses are aggregated on the [GCS](https://www.gauss-centre.eu/trainingsworkshops) and [EuroCC](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/services/training/) portals, have discounted participation fees for PhD students and employees of European academic institutions. Universities could probably create extra incentives to attend these courses by offering ECTS points upon completion. RSE courses could also be added to the academic curriculum (examples: Stuttgart [Software Engineering](https://campus.uni-stuttgart.de/cusonline/pl/ui/$ctx/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=281980&pSpracheNr=1&pMUISuche=FALSE), SSE [lecture material](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/Lecture-Material)).

###### Certification

There is a project to draft a standardized HPC certification program and a "standardized HPC test" (like standardized English proficiency tests, [slides](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/JulianKunkel_HPCCertification_presentation.pdf)) at CASTIEL, under the initiative of Martina Blazkova, as part of "CASTIEL WP3: Training, Twinning and Mentoring" (in their terminology, mentoring = one-way knowledge transfer, twinning = two-way knowledge transfer). The results of this project could be used as a guide for RSE certification.

##### Relevant items in the literature

Below is a collection of publications that could give us some ideas of what is currently being discussed in the RSE literature with regards to training and teaching. Some of these papers are quite old, but we can follow papers that cite them to discover more material relevant to the discussion.

###### Guides to train RSEs
* Grossfield 2021, *How to be a Good Member of a Scientific Software Community*, doi:[10.33011/livecoms.3.1.1473](https://doi.org/10.33011/livecoms.3.1.1473)
   * tips and tricks to join the research software community in your field
   * suitable for a general audience
* Fehr et al. 2021, *Sustainable Research Software Hand-Over*, doi:[10.5334/jors.307](https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.307)
   * good practices for a seamless research software handover to the next PhD student
   * suitable for academic researchers with short tenure
* Fogel, 2017, *Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Project*, O'Reilly Media, 2nd edition [https://producingoss.com/](https://producingoss.com/)
   * training manual for RSEs

* Irving et al. 2021, *Research Software Engineering with Python*, [https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/](https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/)
   * training manual for RSEs who use Python

###### Surveys
* Carver et al. 2013, *Self-Perceptions about Software Engineering: A Survey of Scientists and Engineers*, doi:[10.1109/MCSE.2013.12](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCSE.2013.12)
   * self-perceived level of proficiency in several aspects of the RSE job description (Figure 2)
* Milewicz et al. 2018, *Talk to Me: A Case Study on Coordinating Expertise in Large-Scale Scientific Software Projects*, doi:[10.1109/eScience.2018.00010](https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2018.00010)
   * knowledge transfer in large software projects
* Moldon et al. 2021, *How Gamification Affects Software Developers: Cautionary Evidence from a Natural Experiment on GitHub*, doi:[10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00058](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE43902.2021.00058)
   * how gamification on GitHub affects RSE behavior (for discussion on the usefulness and limitations of "shiny badges" as a mode of RSE certification)
* Besker et al. 2022, *The use of incentives to promote technical debt management*, doi:[10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106740](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106740)
   * techniques and forcing mechanisms to incentivize or deincentivize technical debt management in software engineering teams

###### RSE discourse and open questions
* Lamprecht et al. 2022, *What Do We (Not) Know About Research Software Engineering?*, doi:[10.5334/jors.384](https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.384)
   * with this workshop, we could potentially address three open questions at once
   * in section 3.1.1. People:
     > 7. What would RSEs have liked to learn before starting
     > their RSE careers? What skills will someone starting
     > an RSE career in five years need?
     > 8. Should RSE training be part of the curriculum of
     > every student?

     these questions fit pretty well with the workshop theme.
   * in section 3.1.2. Policy:
     > 6. What are suitable merit evaluation schemes/
     > metrics for RSEs?

     could be partially answered by the discussion on RSE certification

###### Success stories and field-specific best practice guides

Could be used as resources by new RSEs to get up to speed in their new role. Could also help raise awareness among principal investigators about the benefits of training their researchers to become RSEs.

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/) are highly rated open online course providers that offers many courses related to the required knowledge of RSEs. Participants get a certificate for successful participation. Upon successful completion, the Cluster of Excellence SimTech covers the expenses of specific Coursera courses for doctoral students and a course can count as graduate school unit. At the Cluster of Excellence IntCDC we are in the process to also offer financial support.
