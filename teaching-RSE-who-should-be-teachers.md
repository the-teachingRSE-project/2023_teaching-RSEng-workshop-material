- Moderator: [name=Renato Alves]

- Present here today: The Carpentries, Code Refinery, ELIXIR
- Other training communities?
    - Programming language specific initiatives communities
    - Other coordinated efforts (please add under [Notes](#Notes) below)?
- Bringing SE's to Research?
- Bringing Researchers to SE?

## Food for thought

- Incentives for instructors?
- Community recognition / certification / kudos?
- *Pro bono*, in-kind culture / beyond volunteering time?

## Notes

Multiple levels:

Who are the trainers?
Who trains the trainers?
Those with pedagogical training/background?

Importance of the trainer mindset?

- Importance of the topic? Specific training from professional software engineers or is the experience in RSE's enough to teach peers?

Curriculum for trainers? Teaching RSE tools/skills? But how do we teach the research part to someone with a SE background? 

Learning from peers. Good teachers vs bad teachers?

Differences from Industry and Academy in terms of software engineering


Bringing software engineering skills to people from different research domains = easier
Bringing knowledge from different research fields to software engineers = harder

RSE drain to Industry - Anything that can be done to prevent it? (other than better pay in Academy)

Master in Trieste teaching HPC. Researchers/Scientists as primary audience.

Handling the RTFM situations. RTFM with a pedagogical mindset
