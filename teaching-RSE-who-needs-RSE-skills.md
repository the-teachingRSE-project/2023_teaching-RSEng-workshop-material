# Who needs RSE skills?

Who needs RSE Skills and When.
Think about instances where in hindsight you had the feeling, if you were given the right hint everything
would have been easier.


Outcome of workshop:
We figured out that an important question is how much does someone need at a certain level?

We came to the conclusion that at different levels a different amount of RSE competencies is required.
A possible 2D Matrix to represent that is  given along the axes career path (Domain Scientist -> RSE) and career level(BSc -> PostDoc/Prof)

Other Dimensions are given by the problem size that is tackled by the software, the size of the organization and also different domains.

We identified therefore the need to have different RSE Skill levels and the need to define these skillsets.


The specialization to full RSE knowledge makes a good transition point to RSE Departments.
