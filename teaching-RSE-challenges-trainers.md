# RSE trainers
Moderator: Florian Goth
## Top 5 challenges in teaching RSE skills
- Outreach(This has two components: Informing people that the workshop exists, and the MOTIVATING the people to invest the time)
- adapting the material to the audience
- Organization/Preparation
- Expectation Management
- Language Barrier(could also be your teaching personality in a foreign language)/use of jargon
- Learning/improving from your own experiences

Other issues
- Selecting the right courses
- staying up-to-date
- capacity
- identifying demand/creating material
- keeping in contact with students

## Do we need certified trainers?
We found the following items in our discussion:
- Certificates help the job description
- It should still be open to non-certified trainers simialr to the SWC model
- Each trainer should have the opportunity to educate themselves

## Which organization structures do we need to establish? Which Organization do you want to have?
- RSE Trainers need assistance(secretaries!)
- Maybe establish common infrastructures that help the creation of common material
