- Moderator: Philipp Thiele

## Top 5 things you were missing when you learned RSE skills

- Stuff that works out of the box (especially software)
- Good practices 
- How to get in touch with the (software)community. Especially for the software you work on. And also general slacks and mailing lists of general groups UK-RSE etc.
- Training ("there was no training in my time")
- Debugging 

## Do we need certification programmes for RSEs?

- Do we?
    - yes
        - good for job applications
    - no 
        - could be an uncontrolled growth of certification processes and organizations.

# RSEs group 2
- Moderator: Heidi Seibold

## Top 5 things you were missing when you learned RSE skills

- Awareness about best practices (checklists)
- Awareness about learning possibilities
- Hands on guidance (training, mentorship, peer learning)
- How to support others / each other?
- How can I find like-minded people / communities? (What is an RSE?)

## Do we need certification programmes for RSEs?

- Do we want certificates?
    - Yes
        - Good for CV?
        - Making hiring easier
        - Gamification is helpful
    - No
        - Not really helpful?
        - More unorganised may be more efficient


- Types of "certification"
    - Shiny badges
       - personal badges to reward positive contributions to the community, such as [Fedora Badges](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/explore/badges) which cover all aspects of RSE work (code development, packaging, documentation, outreach to the general public, conference attendance), or [GitHub Achievements](https://github.com/Schweinepriester/github-profile-achievements)) which reward participation in major engineering projects or activity in pull requests and discussions
       - project badges to reflect good coding practices of a team, e.g. code coverage ([codecov](https://about.codecov.io/product/feature/badges/)), continuous integration pipeline status ([GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge)), code quality ([Codeclimate](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/overview#badges) for maintainability, [Snyk](https://snyk.io/blog/instant-security-information-with-the-snyk-security-badge/) for security, [LGTM](https://web.archive.org/web/20220818194839/https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/adding-badges-to-project-readme-files) for code smells)
    - Standardized certificates
    - "Nice" sheet of paper
       - can always be helpful when applying for a position where RSE skills are required
    - Attendance sheet
       - the graduate school of the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 1093 would ask PhD students to list all conferences, workshops, summer schools, university lectures and practicals they attended and document whether they gave a talk or had a poster during such events, so that this information could be summarized into a certificate signed by the CRC organizer (meant to help in job applications for post-docs)
    - ECTS credits
       - can be interesting to PhD students and ERASMUS students, who are quite free to choose their study program (to some extent: they still need to seek approval from their graduate school resp. ERASMUS coordinator)
       - I once co-organized an online CECAM school about novel techniques for algorithm development for partial differential equation solvers and their use in soft matter physics (not 100% RSE, but coding was a big part of the school), and a participant from a university in a different country submitted me a form to apply for ECTS credits at their graduate school for attending the event, which I happily filled out for them
       - make RSE training part of university curricula
    
- We'd need standardization
    - Central entity
    - Institutions/people that are allowed to teach

- Certification for certain skills
    - E.g. HPC, Git, specific programming languages, FAIR principles for data and software, cloud-based solutions (remotely executable notebooks), ...
    - Tracks: for certain sub-categories and levels
